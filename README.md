# Titanic
A classic machine learning approach for the Kaggle Titanic dataset

Here we develope some classic machine learning algorithms to 
predict the Survival chance on the Kaggle famous dataset Titanic.

The used variables for predicion are "Sex", "Embark", "Fare", "Age", "SibSp","Parch"
and "Pclass".

We will use the classic algorithms of Sklearn: Logistic Regression,
Random Forest and Support Vector Machine over the same dataset 
after some data-cleaning.

Finally we will make a simple Majority vote algorithm that
take "the most" voted prediction between all the previous 
algorithms to get a new predic
